Preface

YouTube currently hosts [over 20 billion videos](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/happy-birthday-youtube-20/#:~:text=now%20over%2020%20billion%20uploaded%20videos%2C), making it the largest video-sharing website of all time. First of all… Goddamn\! No one will ever comb through all of those videos... Nobody. The ocean of videos out there is so vast that it would take thousands of years to watch a quarter of them. I’ve been using YouTube for 20 years, and sometimes I wonder if I’ve even watched 100,000 videos in total... No idea. 

	There’s been something I’ve always thought about while using YouTube: *How likely is it to get your video on the front page?* Billions of videos are ‘fighting’ to get featured there, but only very few actually make it. How few? Besides your behavior and watch-history on the site, what does it take for a video to be recommended to you and everyone else? On the flip side I began to wonder, *how many videos are left behind and never make it to the recommended feed?*

	Back when I still had MingKasterMK, I’d see my own high-performing videos appear on other peoples’ for-you pages and suggested video feeds. It was the trippiest thing to see in real time. I’d be watching a random video by a random YouTuber; they’d scroll through YouTube and suddenly there I am\! in their suggested feed. What are the odds of that? It made me think that the ‘front page’ had to be VERY small, and all of us were generally coming across the same small pool of videos. 

I decided to google-search for some answers regarding view count:

I google-searched **“What percentage of YouTube videos have over 1 million views?”**  
\-[0.33%. *Less than half of a percent of all YT videos have over 1 million views.*](https://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-youtube-videos-by-views-2009-5#ixzz2viYjjnG2)  
	**“What percentage of YouTube videos have less than 1000 views?”**  
\-[*93% of all YT videos have under 1000 views*](https://www.intotheminds.com/blog/en/research-youtube-stats/#:~:text=93%25%3A%20the%20number%20of%20YouTube%20videos%20with%20less%20than%201000%20views).  
	**“Less than 100 views?”**  
\-[*30% of all YT videos have under 100 views*](https://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-youtube-videos-by-views-2009-5#ixzz2viYjjnG2)*.*

**\~6 Billion YouTube videos have less than 100 views…** I think it’s safe to say that **there are at least a billion videos out there with no views at all.** This group of low-view videos is what I call “YouTube’s Video Graveyard.”

	I wondered if there was a way I could access those videos. I knew there would be lost gems within these obscure uploads. I also knew there would be a lot of randomness in there as well (test uploads, 5 seconds of nothing, intimate moments with family members, school projects, zoom calls, unhinged ramblers, potential serial killers, etc.). I was eager to find a way in, but I didn’t really know what to search to get there. 

	One day I was on Discord with Michael (Mika\_Virus) and we were fucking around on one of those websites that show you YouTube videos with low views. Those websites were alright at what they did, but we noticed they never actually showed us videos with 0 views. There were always over 100 or so views on the videos. Also, the videos were never older than 1 month. We questioned if it was possible to access the more dated ones.

	That day, the site we liked using was down for no reason at all, so we had to get creative. One of the videos we had saved in our chat had a title that matched up with a default filename given to recorded videos from the iPhone: IMG followed by 4 numbers. We tried typing ‘IMG 3201’ into the YouTube search bar, and we were mindblown. Thousands of uploads were named IMG 3201\. Using YouTube’s filter system and sorting by view count, we could now find those 0-view uploads. Then we tried searching for IMG 3202, IMG 3203, IMG 3204… hundreds more 0-view results appeared. We were geeking at how vast this side was.

It then became our mission to find as many ‘active’ default filenames as possible in an attempt to continuously access the graveyard. Through doing this, we compiled a big-ass list of keyphrases that I dubbed “YouTube’s Recycle Bin.” With the help of all of you out there, the list continues to grow. We’ve probably only accessed less than 0.05% of the video graveyard, but due to the sheer size of the graveyard, we are eating well off of this small slice.

Just like I predicted, I’ve found absolute GEMS while on this side of YouTube. This side of YouTube feels way more human than the more polished side. This feels like [sonder](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/sonder), like the way YouTube used to be. I guess it still is that way, only now you gotta look under the hood.

**What is it?**

What is YouTube’s Recycle Bin (YRB)?

**YRB represents all the videos on YouTube with little to no views, and *no real titles*.** These are videos that the algorithm won’t recommend to you (initially). Since there’s no information attached to the video (no normal video title, no tags, no description), the algorithm doesn’t know what to classify the video as, and doesn’t push the video out to other users. This could be the case for years and years, leaving the video completely lost to the outside world.

The only way to access these videos is to **search for the “keyphrase” associated with the device / application that was used to record the video.** These keyphrases are usually the default filename given to a recorded or downloaded video by the device / application.

I compiled a list of keyphrases that will take us to YouTube’s video graveyard. We call it ‘The Maps.’ Using YouTube’s search bar, Map 1 helps you find brand new videos with \~0 views, and Map 2 helps you find old & forgotten videos with \~0 views. IT’S NOT PERFECT. Some leads work better than others, but yeah you get it.
